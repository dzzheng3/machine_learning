he main objectives of this project is to develop a prototype system for recognition thepaddy disease which are Paddy Blast Disease, Brown Spot Disease, and Narrow BrownSpot and the bean disease which are golden mosaic ,halo blight, and bean rust . Thispaper concentrate on the image processing techniques used to enhance the quality of theimage and neural network technique to classify the paddy and bean disease. Themethodology involves image acquisition, pre-processing, analysis and classification ofthe paddy disease. All the paddy and bean sample will be passing through the RGBcalculation before it proceed to the binary conversion. If the sample is in the range ofnormal paddy RGB, then it is automatically classify as Normal. Then, all the segmentedpaddy disease sample will be convert into the binary data in data base before proceedthrough the neural network for training and testing. Consequently, by employing theneural network technique, the paddy and bean diseases are recognized about 80 percentaccuracy rates. This prototype has a very great potential to be further improved in thefuture.
